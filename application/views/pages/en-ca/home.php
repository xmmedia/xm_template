<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>By default FirePHP is used for debugging, this can be overridden easily by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using Firefox, you need to have Firebug and FirePHP add-ons installed.  Once this is done, you should be able to
open firebug and see the debugging and benchmark data in the console. Sometimes you have to restart the browser to make this work.</p>
